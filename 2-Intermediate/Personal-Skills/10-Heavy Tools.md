# Heavy Tools
 
As our technological culture progresses, software technology moves from inconceivable, to research, to new products, to standardized products, to widely available and inexpensive products. These heavy tools can pull great loads, but can be intimidating and require a large investment in understanding. The intermediate programmer has to know how to manage them and when they should be used or considered.

To my mind right now some of the best heavy tools are:

- Relational Databases,
- Full-text Search Engines,
- Math libraries,
- OpenGL,
- XML parsers, and
- Spreadsheets.
